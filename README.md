👋 Hi, I’m @MadameMountain, but you can call me Lis, too.
👀 I’m interested in web development, data structur and basically everything what makes websites ✨ fabulous ✨.
🌱 I’m currently learning the JavaScript, UX Design and all the "how-to-build-a-great-webside", including React.js and Typescript.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything.
